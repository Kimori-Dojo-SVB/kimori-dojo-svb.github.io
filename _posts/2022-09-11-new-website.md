The website went down for about a week, so I needed to get a new one up pretty quick.
This is a work in progress, but hopefully I'll have fun learning a bunch of new things as I make this site work.
I've cobbled together a ton of new technologies, but this isn't the place to geek out about computer stuff, this is an Aikido site.
I'll be importing a bunch of images and content from the old site in the near future, but I'm happy to have something back up for now.
If you want to train with us, please use the [Contact Us](/contactus) page or email <kimoridojo@gmail.com> and we'll get you on the mat.
